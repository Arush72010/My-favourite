        <p>My hobbies are to Read Books, Cooding and Play Free Fire. Reading books are very important for everyone to improve their vocabulary. I like text base cooding because I like to type using keboard. I play Free Fire for some time for entertainment.

        <p>My favourite books are of Geronimo Stilton and Harry Potter. I have read many books of Geronimo Stilton but only 2 of Harry Potter. The author of Geronimo Stilton books is Elisabetta Dami. I like these books because the are funny, intrestting and mysterious.
            The author of Harry Potter books is J.K. Rowling. These books are scary, mysterious and has suspence which is the reason for liking these books.</p>
